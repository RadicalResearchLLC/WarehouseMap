#Warehouse Map App 
#Created by Mike McCarthy, Radical Research LLC
#Inspired by Graham Brady and Susan Phillips at Pitzer College 
#and their code here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Op4GgmK0A_0mUHAf9qqXzT_aekbdLb_ZFtBaZKfj6w/edit

#This downloads and tidies up parcel data from Riverside County for warehouse and light industrial classes
#It is then displayed in a leaflet map
#Later versions will contain an R Shiny app tool
