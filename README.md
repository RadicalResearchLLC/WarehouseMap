The Warehouse CITY (communitY Cumulative Impact Tool) dashboard is a tool developed to help visualize and quantify the development of warehouses in Southern California. This dashboard is a result of a collaboration between the Redford Conservancy at Pitzer College and Radical Research LLC. The goal of this tool is to help community organizations understand and quantify the cumulative impacts of existing and planned warehouses. It builds off work done at the Redford Conservancy and published in the Los Angeles Times.
